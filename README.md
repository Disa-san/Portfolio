# Portfolio

I enjoyed working with this project. I feel like I am still behind on some of the basics of HTML and CSS and this project served as a good catcher upper for me. 

I struggled with aligning the text on my flex boxÂ´ed items ("Featured projects" and "for more") I will be happy to receive some feedback on how to get them nicely aligned, rather than the just hovering in the vicinity of each other, like they are now. 

Regarding the validation I was pleasantly surprised that I found it quite fun and easy to work with, at least on this "simple" project. I had to leave one error on the HTML. It was the link with the fonts that included a symbol that was not allowed (|). I was also working with my color choices for a while, to improve the contrasts on the site. In the end I decided to leave the error on the contrast of the heading. I believe there is no way for me to improve this without either changing the background picture or stepping outside of the guidelines for this project. For the final version of the portfolio I will make sure to change the picture.
